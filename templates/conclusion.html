	<ul>
		<li>In this project, we presented word segmentation program for Myanmar text based on World Wide Web.</li>
		<li>Then, we presented both word level and character level by this program.</li>
		<li>The program performed segmentation work well and proved itself to be used as a pratical word.</li>
		<li>For future task, we plan to extend our program by converting all possible 
		Myanmar words.</li>
		<li>It is hope that this project will give benefits for our Myanmar language development tasks.</li>
